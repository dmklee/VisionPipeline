Main Issues to contend with:
    [1] know where a valid edge exists
        ~[1.1] sobel operator to calculate E, Gx, Gy
        ~[1.2] identify local maximums of E
        ~[1.3] shift seed locations up hill
        [1.4] disregard unstable seeds
            [1.4.1] look for linear fit accuracy
            [1.4.2] look for consistent grad_ids nearby

    [2] know when to stop following an edge
        ~[2.1] break when sign of curvature changes
            ~[2.1.1] fit linear model to the curvature
            [2.1.2] make error tolerance adaptive to noise in image
        ~[2.2] break when edgel strength is too weak
            ~[2.2.1] store information of normal edgel strength

    [3] handling redundancy/overlap between contours

    [4] identify location/shape of contour accurately
        [4.1a] use ransac, keep randomly sampling 3 points along length of contour
        [4.1b] ockhams razor, line then circular arc
        
    [5] know how to predict behavior of an contour
    [6] joining/relating contours into surfaces (ellipses, rectangles)
        [6.1] look for contours that touch
        [6.2] look for corners/centers of rotation
    [7] handling noisy data
        [7.1] have adaptive thresholding based on "noisiness" factor
